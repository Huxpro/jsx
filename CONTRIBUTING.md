# Contributing to JSX

Thank you for your interest in contributing to JSX!

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

* [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
* [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)

## Ways to Contribute

### Spec Bugs

Our current focus is to correctly document the existing semantics in the implementation reality, and collaboratively discuss and spec out where implementations diverged to minimize inconsistencies of using JSX. 

To report a spec bug, we encourage you to attach links to the relevant implementations like [here](https://github.com/facebook/jsx/issues/120) and [here](https://github.com/facebook/jsx/pull/136#issuecomment-1050755242).

### Feature Proposals

As JSX having been widely adopted and perceived as stablized for years, the team has been convinced that it's usually not worth the churn for existing JSX users and decided to freeze the feature sets of the current JSX.

Feature proposals are still welcome but they will only be considered as part of a larger and cohesive breaking changes such as JSX 2.0.

## Contributing To The Spec

The JSX specification is written in [ecmarkup](https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup), TC39's official tool for specifying syntax and semantics of ECMAScript and generating spec websites. You can find how to use it there.

We welcome both editorial and normative changes. However, normative changes may only be merged if a concensus can be reached from major implementations.

We encourage you to attach a screenshot of the updated section of the spec to make the review easier.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.
